[Modbus](http://www.modbus.org/) is a serial communication protocol to control PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller).
It supports various types of devices which can be controlled over serial, TCP, and UDP connections.

## Configuration

How to add modbus to your installation depends on the connection type, either a network or serial connection.

Platforms:
  - binary_sensor
  - climate
  - cover
  - sensor
  - switch

are all defined as part of the modbus configuration. The old configuration style, (having each outside the modbus configuration is still supported, but will cause a warning, and will be removed in a later release).

### Network connection

For a network connection, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for a TCP connection
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
```

{% configuration %}
delay:
  description: Time to sleep in seconds after connecting and before sending messages. Some modbus-tcp servers need a short delay typically 1-2 seconds in order to prepare the communication. If a server accepts connecting, but there is no response to the requests send, this parameter might help.
  required: false
  default: 0
  type: integer
host:
  description: The IP address of your Modbus device, e.g., 192.168.1.1.
  required: true

Possible values are `tcp` (Modbus TCP protocol according to "MODBUS Messaging Implementation Guide version 1.0b" provided by Schneider Automation.), `udp`(Modbus TCP form, but using UDP for transport. It removes the overheads required for TCP.) and `rtuovertcp` (Modbus RTU message transmitted with a TCP/IP wrapper and sent over a network instead of serial lines.).
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Services

### Service `modbus.set-temperature`

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| set_temperature | Set Temperature. Requires `value` to be passed in, which is the desired target temperature. `value` should be in the same type as `data_type` |

### Configuring platform cover

The `modbus` cover platform allows you to control [Modbus](http://www.modbus.org/) covers (such as blinds, a roller shutter, or a garage door).

At the moment, we support the opening and closing of a cover. You can control your covers either using coils or holding registers.

Cover that uses the `coil` attribute is not able to determine intermediary states such as opening and closing. Coil stores only two states â€” "0" means cover closed, and "1" implies cover open. To allow detecting intermediary states, we added an optional `status_register` attribute. It will enable you to write your command (e.g., to open a cover) into a coil, and read current cover status back through the register. Additionally, you can specify values for `state_open`, `state_opening`, `state_closed`, and `state_closing` attributes. These will be matched with the value read from the `status_register`.

If your cover uses holding register to send commands (defined by the `register` attribute), it can also read the intermediary states. To adjust which value represents what state, you can fine-tune the optional state attributes, like `state_open`. These optional state values are also used for specifying values written into the register. If you specify an optional status_register attribute, cover states will be read from status_register instead of the register used for sending commands.

To use Modbus covers in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        device_class: door

        scan_interval: 1
        register: 0
        state_open: 1
        state_closed: 0
```

#### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a coil

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a coil. Intermediary states like opening/closing are not supported. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        coil: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
      - name: Door2
        slave: 2
        coil: 2
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
```

#### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a coil, it's state is read from the register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a coil. Actual cover state is read from the `status_register`. We've also specified register values to match with the states open/opening/closed/closing. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        coil: 1
        status_register: 1
        status_register_type: input
        state_opening: 1
        state_open: 2
        state_closing: 3
        state_closed: 4
```

#### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a holding register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a holding register, from which we also read current cover state. We've also specified register values to match with the states open/opening/closed/closing. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        register: 1
        state_opening: 1
        state_open: 2
        state_closing: 3
        state_closed: 4
```

#### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a holding register, it's state is read from the status register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a holding register. However, cover state is read from a `status_register`. In this case, we've specified only values for `state_open` and `state_closed`, for the rest, default values are used. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        register: 1
        status_register: 2
        register_type: holding
        state_open: 1
        state_closed: 0
```

      type: integer
    verify_register:
      description: Register to readback.
      required: false
      default: same as register
      type: string
    verify_state:
      description: Define if is possible to readback the status of the switch.
      required: false
      default: true
      type: boolean
{% endconfiguration %}

#### Full example

Example switches, for which the state is polled from Modbus every 15 seconds (default).

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    switches:
      - name: Switch1
        slave: 1
        address: 13
        input_type: coil
      - name: Switch2
        slave: 2
        address: 14
```

#### Multiple connections

Multiple connections are possible, add something like the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for multiple TCP connections
modbus:
  - type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS_1
    port: 2020
    name: hub1

  - type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS_2
    port: 501
    name: hub2
```

### Service `modbus.write_register`

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| write_register | Write register. Requires `hub`, `unit`, `address` and `value` fields. `value` can be either single value or an array |

Description:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| hub       | Hub name (defaults to 'default' when omitted) |
| unit      | Slave address (1-255, mostly 255 if you talk to Modbus via TCP) |
| address   | Address of the Register (e.g., 138) |
| value     | A single value or an array of 16-bit values. Single value will call modbus function code 6. Array will call modbus function code 16. Array might need reverse ordering. E.g., to set 0x0004 you might need to set `[4,0]` |

### Service `modbus.write_coil`

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| write_coil | Write coil. Requires `hub`, `unit`, `address` and `state` fields. `state` can be either single bolean or an array |

Description:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| hub       | Hub name (defaults to 'default' when omitted) |
| unit      | Slave address (1-255, mostly 255 if you talk to Modbus via TCP) |
| address   | Address of the Register (e.g., 138) |
| state     | A single boolean or an array of booleans. Single boolean will call modbus function code 6. Array will call modbus function code 16.

## Log warning (v1.0.8 and onwards)

Pymodbus (which is the implementation library) was updated and issues a warning:

 - "Not Importing deprecated clients. Dependency Twisted is not Installed"

This warning can be safely ignored, and have no influence on how the integration
works!

## Opening an issue

When opening an issue, please add your current configuration (or a scaled down version), with at least:

 - the Modbus configuration lines
 - the entity (sensor, etc.) lines

In order for the developers better to identify the problem, please add the
following lines to configuration.yaml:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.modbus: debug
    pymodbus.client: debug
```

and restart Home Assistant, reproduce the problem, and include the log in the issue.
